# Getting Started

This app is hosted at https://weather-app-ryujignh.netlify.app/.

### Start the app.

Run `npm start` to start running the app.

### Developer Comments

This app uses the public API from metaweather.com.
This API does not allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), so you will need to request the API through a proxy server.
The proxy server is hosted on heroku at `https://sheltered-eyrie-68708.herokuapp.com`. Also, a proxy server can be easily built.
